<h1 align="center">RIP DIGI PRO</h1>
<p align="center">Because I spent too much time on CodingGame and playing other things, my sound project is definitely not going to be finished.</p>
<p align="center">Am sorry Dennis, I really tried but you never taught us the things and just told us to "make sound program" despite not even knowing C#</p>
<p align="center">Because of this, I'll take my 0 and just cry as I fail every final as well.</p>
<p align="center">RIP</p>

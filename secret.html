	<h1>RIP C++ MIDTERM</h1>
		<p>If you're reading this, I'm definitely going to fail the midterm tomorrow.</p>
		<p>Classes are stupid and I'm going back to java because Albert doesn't know how to teach.</p>
		<p>Am sorry Albert, I tried my best but I can't do it, classes are just stupid.</p>
		<p>RIP</p>
